This repository contains an example of a common error in Python programming: RecursionError. The code implements a recursive function that calculates Fibonacci numbers.  For larger inputs, the function exceeds Python's maximum recursion depth, resulting in a RecursionError. The solution demonstrates how to overcome this limitation by using memoization or iteration.
